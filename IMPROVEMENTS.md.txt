UI that can be approved:

1. Add a column to show if an email has been read or not. If this is an admin system, an easy way of doing this would be to attach a 1x1 transparent pixel inside each email, and call an API when the email is opened to get that 1x1 pixel image.
2. Allow searching by Email and Body, not just Subject.
3. Have all dates be in the same format to avoid user confusion.
4. Date Time picker instead of just a date picker. Some companies have thousands of emails going out every hour. This would help find specific emails in the system without having to go through the database.
5. Allow the entire table to be striped with colors. Having the entire table white is sore on the eyes and can be rather bland to look at.
6. Allow emails to be seperated into different folders for easier sorting.
